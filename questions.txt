1.  <stdint.h> is a header file that includes definitions for the new integer datatypes are useful in embedded environments where hardware usually supports only several types and that support varies between different environments.

2.  The size of a byte/long/word is up to the compiler writer but The size of a uint8_t/uint32_t/uint16_t is constant. When this is used, every compiler in the world needs to allocate that many bits and treat the value as an unsigned/signed as mentioned.

3.  BYTE - 1
    DWORD- 4
    LONG - 4
    WORD - 2
    
4.  The first two bytes are contained in the the BITMAPFILEHEADER  and BITMAPINFOHEADER.

5.  bftype- contained in BITMAPFILE header, has an offset of 0 and is of WORD type.
    bitype- contained in BITMAPINFO header, has an offset of 14 and is of DWORD type.
    
6.   If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB and its origin is the upper-left corner.

7.  biBitcount

8.  If the pointer does not point to any proper address, i.e if the file to be read/written does not exist

9.  Because the third parameter of fread indicates the number of elements being read

10. padding = 3.

11. fseek() sets the file position of the stream to the given offset

12. It is the current position of the file pointer, the position from where offset is added.
